# Continual Learning On LLM for Chemical Reactions

We will utilize the Mistral-7B, a 7.3B parameter language model using the transformers architecture.

### Porting Model Weights to JAX
The Mistral-7B model weights needs to be ported to JAX/Equinox. This can be done by following the steps described in the [mistral_jax](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/mistral_jax/blob/main/instructions.md) repo. Alternatively, one can also download them from [here](https://buffalo.box.com/s/ljd66kpkgte8duofz3us2zihb70btwww). 

### Installation
